# LearningSDL

This repository will house my SDL based learning project.

The plan for this project is as follows:

1: Implement basic GPU accelerated rendering
2: Implement game loop to allow interaction with rendered environment
3: Graduate to a new repository where the project will evolve into a game engine (and maybe even a game)

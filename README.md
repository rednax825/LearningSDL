# LearningSDL

## Overview

This repository will house my SDL based learning project.

The plan for this project is as follows:

1. Implement basic GPU accelerated rendering
2. Implement game loop to allow interaction with rendered environment
3. Graduate to a new repository where the project will evolve into a game engine (and maybe even a game)

## Project Setup

### Building

WINDOWS: Before building, add the path to your local copy of the SDL2 library to and environment variable called "SDL2"

To build this project, create a new directory called "build"

From this directory, call `cmake ../`

From the build directory, use preferred build tool to compile an executable

### Running

Create a new directory called "bin"


Run that exe!
